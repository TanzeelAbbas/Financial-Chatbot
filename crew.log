In terms of option volume, AAPL has a volume of 5000, GOOG has a volume of 6000, and MSFT has a volume of 5500. High option volume generally indicates that there is a significant interest in the stock. However, the term 'high' is relative and without a benchmark or average to compare against, it's difficult to definitively state if these volumes are considered high.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) has an option volume of 5000. This high volume indicates a significant amount of trading activity, suggesting that the stock is popular among traders. Despite its low price, the high option volume could potentially signal a strong market interest in AAPL.

Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) has an option volume of 6000. Similar to AAPL, the high option volume suggests that GOOG is a popular choice among traders. The low price combined with the high option volume could make GOOG an attractive option for investors looking for affordable stocks with high trading activity.

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) has an option volume of 7000, the highest among the three stocks. The high option volume indicates a strong market interest in MSFT. Despite its low price, the high trading activity could potentially signal a strong market interest in MSFT.

These stocks could be attractive options for investors looking for affordable stocks with high trading activity. However, it is important to note that while high option volume can indicate strong market interest, it does not necessarily guarantee future performance.

This suggests a high level of interest and activity in Apple's stock, which could be due to various factors such as recent news, earnings reports, or changes in the market.

The second highest option volume is for The Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) with 30,920 contracts. Although this is significantly lower than Apple's option volume, it still represents a substantial amount of activity.

American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL) and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) also have high option volumes with 28,766 and 20,527 contracts respectively. This could indicate investor interest in the airline industry and the broader market index.

Class B (BRK.B) have the lowest option volumes in the top 10 list with 4,530, 4,394, 3,032, and 2,532 contracts respectively.
